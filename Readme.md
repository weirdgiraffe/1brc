This is the attempt to create a solution for the [The One Billion Row
Challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) but written in go. 

- It will use the data generator from the original challange
- It can not be benchmarked on the remote machine, so all benchmarks will be
  running on my local machine, and I can just benchmark against other java
  solutions.
